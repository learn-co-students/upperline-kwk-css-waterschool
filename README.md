![Waterschool Photo](/images/waterschool.jpg)
## Objectives

1. Practice using the Bootstrap Framework to make websites beuatiful
2. Learn about the Swarovski Waterschool program

## Instructions

The team at Swarovski Waterschool has been busy building out their initiatives to introduce students around the world to important ecological, social and cultural issues around water worldwide. They've established Waterschools in India, China, Uganda, Austria and Brazil (and are hoping to establish many more) to make sure that students feel educated about and empowered to make a change around water-related issues in their communities.

The Swarovski team has approached Kode With Klossy with a special project. They are rebuilding their country-specific information pages about WaterSchool and are looking for new and interesting designs for their site. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to choose one of the Waterschool location and build a Bootstrap (or Materialize)-backed website. The site should tell users about water related issues in the country or city in question, and discuss current and future solutions to those problems.

Choose from:
+ India
+ China
+ Brazil
+ Uganda
+ Los Angeles or California
+ Your Hometown

Feel free to look around the current [Waterschool](http://www.swarovskigroup.com/S/aboutus/Swarovski_Waterschool.en.html) website to gather information and get ideas - but make sure that the layout and design of your site is as different as possible!
